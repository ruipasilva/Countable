# Countr - Visitors Counter

![Countr - Preview](Countr-Preview.jpg)

*Countr - Visitors Counter* is a simple and beautiful counter to easily track footfall in shops or event venues, helping businesses keep their spaces and guests under control.


## Introduction and Goals

Countr is my first app on AppStore. - it's a very simple app for a very specific use case.

Just like [Taskable](https://github.com/ruipasilva/Taskable), I've developed this app thinking of the daily routine I've got in store (I'm a retail manager). With Covid-19 most, if not all, stores were forced to control their traffic, we currently use a completely outdated app designed pre iOS7, so I wanted to create something more pleasing, appeling to the eye and really easy to use. 

Currently developing v1.1
